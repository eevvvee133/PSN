        <h2>Jay's Profile</h2> 

        <h3> <p>Teacher's Name: Mr. Carman </p>
             <p>Date: April 16, 2019 </p>
             <p>Course Code: ICS 4U1</p>
        </h3>
        
        <p>Full Name: Jason Reguero</p>
        
        <p>Birthday: June 4, 2001</p>

        <p>Where I am from?: I am Filipino-Amercian, and I was born in the Philippines, but I moved to America when I was one.  </p>
        
        <p>Interests/Hobbies: I like playing video games and I used to like playing soccer. Other than that, I don't really have that many hobbies. I just spend most of my time doing things everyone else does like hanging out with friends and using social media. </p>
        
        <p>How would you describe yourself?: Not going to lie, but this was the hardest question on the assignment. I think I would describe myself as determined. Well determined enough to complete this assignment today. I would also describe myself as kind, even though I will never be as compassionate as my cousin Jun.  </p>
        
        <p>What do you want to do after graduation this summer?: I just got accepted into the University of Michigan but, I am second guessing this choice. I am not certain of this decision because I haven't decided what I want to career wise. I am thinking about taking a gap year. This might help me decide what I want to do in the future. </p>

        <p>What do you hope to learn in this Computer Science course?: I took this course because I thought it might help me decide what I want to do in the future. I like playing video games and thought this course would show me how they work. I think it would be cool to make my own computer game or work for a gaming company. Who knows? This might end up being my major after I graduate in June. </p>
        
        <p>If you could go back in time and change one thing, what would it be?: If I could go back in time, I would respond to my cousin's final letter from December 26, 2015. If I responded that might have changed something. Maybe if I had responded he wouldn't have run away. Maybe if I had responded he would still be here and alive. It makes me feel guilty knowing I didn't respond to his last letter. I didn't know this would be the last time I heard from him. If I could see him today, the first thing I would say is "I'm sorry". I don't even know if the apology would mean much.</p>

        <p>Other intresting facts: I am completing this assignment from my Tita Chato's house in the Philippens (Tita means Aunt in Tagalog). </p>

        <p2>Mark: 19/23</p2>
